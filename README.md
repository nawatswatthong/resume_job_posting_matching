# Optimizing Resume Compatibility for Automated Screening: Strategies for Enhanced Job Placement Success

This project aims to strategically improve job placement success rate by refining resume compatibility within automated screening systems. The primary objective is to identify key factors that increase a resume's visibility and provide guidance on optimizing applicantsâ€™ resumes. Our approach involves developing a resume matching score system, which is based on three components: technical skills and soft skills extraction (SkillNER), academic qualification extraction (NER), and a network analysis of industry-specific skills and academic fields, derived from an extensive review of over 2000 data scientist and data analyst job postings. The results indicate a significant differentiation in resumes, especially regarding technical skills and academic qualifications. The project's major contribution is the development of a quantifiable system that evaluates the impact of various resume components on job compatibility, offering precise guidance for applicants to tailor their resumes effectively. However, the current challenge is validating the scoring system's accuracy and practical applicability, as it is more theoretical at this stage. Future work will focus on obtaining labeled data to correlate our theoretical findings with real-world job application outcomes, thereby closing the gap between academic research and practical job market demands.
